## Simple Schema Migrations for PostgreSQL

### About

This repository, which began as a simple Gist, provides a tiny starter
kit and instructions for safely performing schema migrations on a
PostgreSQL database. It works by providing a PLPGSQL procedure which
can execute a chunk of SQL and then note it as having been executed,
so that it will not be executed again the next time.

### Installation

Copy `migrations.sql` to your project. Add migrations to the end of
that file in the form of calls to `apply_migration`, as shown in the
examples in that file. To apply all pending migrations, including
bootstrapping the migration function and its `migrations` table, run
the file against your database in a single transaction with psql, or
via your database connection adaptor.

```
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -1f -- migrations.sql yourdbname
```

You should generally arrange to run migrations as the database owner
(or even the super-user), and your applications should use
less-privileged users.
